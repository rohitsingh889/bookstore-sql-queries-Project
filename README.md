## ✨ Author & Portfolio Note  

**Author:** Rohit Raj Singh  

This project is part of my **portfolio**, demonstrating **practical SQL skills** applied to a real-world dataset of an **Online Bookstore**.  
It highlights techniques such as:  
- **Data exploration** (retrieving and filtering data)  
- **Aggregation & calculations** (SUM, AVG, COUNT, MAX/MIN)  
- **Joins & relationships** (combining Books, Customers, Orders)  
- **Subqueries & advanced querying**  
- **Business insights** (customer spending, sales by genre, most popular books)  

This work reflects the kind of SQL expertise essential for **Data Analyst** and **Data Engineer** roles.
